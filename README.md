# FinTech Dynamic Webpage

Welcome to the FinTech Dynamic Webpage project! This project is a simple, interactive web page built with HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript. It demonstrates how to manipulate the DOM dynamically, making changes based on user interactions.

## What This Project Does

- **Dynamic Text Updates:**  
  When you click the "Change Intro Text" button, the text in the introduction section updates with a new message.

- **Live Style Changes:**  
  The "Toggle Section Style" button lets you switch the background color of the interactive section on the fly.

- **Element Adding/Removing:**  
  With the "Add Element" button, you can add a new element to the page, or remove it if it's already there. The button text updates to let you know what it will do next.

The project is structured as follows:

fintech-dynamic-webpage/ ├── index.html # The main HTML file, structured with semantic elements. ├── styles.css # The CSS file with basic styling and responsive design. └── script.js # The JavaScript file that makes the webpage interactive.
